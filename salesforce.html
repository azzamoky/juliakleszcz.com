        <h2>Salesforce Fundamentals</h2>

        <h3>Understanding Salesforce Objects</h3>
        <p>In Salesforce, data is organized into objects, which are like different compartments of your workspace.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Objects:</strong> These are pre-built objects provided by Salesforce, like Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Opportunities. They’re the building blocks of your CRM.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Objects:</strong> These are objects you or your admin can create to store information unique to your business. Think of them as your custom-built tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Records and Fields</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Records:</strong> Each entry in an object is a record, like a row in a spreadsheet. For example, each customer would be a record in the Contacts object.</li>
            <li><strong>Fields:</strong> Fields are individual pieces of data in a record, such as a contact’s email or phone number. They're the cells in your spreadsheet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relationships</h3>
        <p>Salesforce objects can be related to each other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lookup Relationships:</strong> Simple links between objects, like pointing from a Contact to an Account.</li>
            <li><strong>Master-Detail Relationships:</strong> A strong link where the detail record inherits security and sharing settings from the master.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Relationships:</strong> Special relationships within the user object, like an org chart.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Setup and Security</h2>

            <li><strong>Profiles:</strong> Profiles determine what users can see and do in Salesforce. It’s like their job description.</li>
            <li><strong>Permission Sets:</strong> These grant additional permissions to users without changing their profile. Think of them as bonus powers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Roles and Sharing Rules</h3>

        </ul>

            <li><strong>Strong Password Policies:</strong> Ensure users create strong, unique passwords.</li>
