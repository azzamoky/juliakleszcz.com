        <h3>Q: What are Dashboards in Salesforce?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Dashboards are visual representations of your reports, providing a real-time view of key metrics and performance indicators.

Assigning the right profiles ensures that users have the appropriate level of access based on their roles.</p>

        <h3>Q: What are Permission Sets?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Permission Sets are collections of settings and permissions that grant users additional access without changing their profiles.
